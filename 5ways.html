            <h1>5 Ways to live life to the fullest</h1><br>
            <h1>Living life to the fullest means understanding what makes you happy, what really matters, and what you want to achieve.</h1>
                <p>By Samantha Z. Beltran
                <br><br>When you find yourself stuck at work or without the person you love, you think you could probably be living your life better. While it may be easy to feel that you have no control over your existence, it is exactly the opposite. Only you get to decide how to live your life and how you would want to live life to the fullest.

                <h1> happiness on your terms</h1>
                <p>When you decide to live life to the fullest, start by defining happiness on your own terms—not anyone else’s. There will be many people in your life who have personal views on how you should go about your future. They will ask you questions such as: When are you going to have married? Why won’t you have children yet? Shrug it off.
                <br>
                <br>
                    Some people may find happiness when they have reached the top of the career ladder or live in a large home. Others may be happy living a simple yet peaceful life. Only you can decide what makes you happy. Seeking validation from others will only stir feelings of inadequacy and pressure, further hindering yourself from living and experiencing life by your rules. When you no longer define happiness based on other people’s definitions, you will start to feel lighter and at peace.

            <br>
            <p>
                Self-improvement can come from various aspects and can vary from big to small steps. Have you decided to pick up a new skill or hobby during the pandemic? That is already a start at improving yourself. Or perhaps you have decided to become healthier by exercising regularly and watching what you eat. It can even begin from something as simple as deciding to be kinder every day.
                <br>
                <br>
                Striving to be a better version of yourself can only lead to better and more positive things. Soon, it becomes a habit—and constantly working on your growth can allow you to accomplish bigger goals.
